The implemented function is used to perform DC Analysis only.
It is implemented based on MNA Algorithm.
The netlist to be analyzed can contain resistors, current and voltage sources either independent or dependent.
It is preferred that the netlist shouldn't contain comments.
Nodes are ordered positive integers.
No need to determine the type of analysis as it will be ignored. Also, the simulator performs only DC Analysis.
